# Stable Marriage Problem with Genetic Algorithm 💑✨

## Overview 📚

This repository contains an implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm** to solve the **Stable Marriage Problem**. The goal is to find a stable matching between two equally sized groups (e.g., men and women) based on their preferences.

## Problem Statement ❓

The Stable Marriage Problem involves pairing members of two groups such that no pair of individuals would prefer each other over their current partners. This project uses genetic algorithms to explore potential solutions to this classic problem.
